# G a m e o n - Pair Game.

## Pair Game
This is my second assigment from FrontEnd Course. The goal of this project is to test my JavaScript knowledge. This project will hepl me to practice everything that I learnt so far.

My project or pair game is for current and potential student that are learnig to create games or want to improve their skills too. The website is very simple to use. Users will find easy to navagete the website and play the game.   

## **User Stories**

As a potential FrontEnd developer I want to feel confortable using JavaScript and expand my knowledge in one of the most popular language on the internet. As developer I want people to enjoy the games created by me.

I drew my wireframes using Balsamiq. I have pictures or art work that shows how users will see if the access the website on mobile, desttop or tablet.

There are some differences between my wireframes and my final website. This was due to visual preferences and feedback received from other users who tested my website.

## *Features*
1. A header with the words G-A-M-E-O-N
2.  A very basic menu that blends with the header or logo
3. A welcome message 

# Main Page

As soon as the page loads up the user will see:

- All the levels are visible. 

- There are 20 levels with 5 different types of game. 

- The user will experience playing with number, emoji, letters, letters and numbers, emoji and letters and so on...


There are 3 options on menu. By selecting the options, the user can read about the game itself, learn how to play the game and the scores rules. 

The footer is quite simple and there is a link that takes you to github project.

## Features Left to Implement

Once I've learnt JavaScript, I will add further functionality to the existing features on my website, such as:

- The user will be able to register
- The will login to the website and customise the page to their preferences
- The user will save the game and continue from where left
- The user will see a chart displaying all the best personal scores and others players too

I would like to implement a feature called - challenge of the day, that allows playeres to get bonus point and keep them happy.


## Balsamiq
I've used Balsamiq to create wireframes of my website before building the actual site.

**HTML5**
The project uses HTML5 to create the basic elements and content of my website.

**CSS3**
The project uses CSS3 to add custom styles to the elements and content of my website.

**JavaScritp**
Every script is written in pure JavaScript language only.

**Bootstrap v4.3**
The project uses Bootstrap v4.6 to add a responsive grid system, prebuilt components, plugins built on jQuery, and Bootstrap styles to my website, before adding my custom styles.

**JavaScript**
The project uses JavaScript from Bootstrap which is required to add functionality to some of Bootstrap's components.

**Git**
I've used Git as a version control system to regularly add and commit changes made to project in Cloud9, before pushing them to GitHub.

**GitHub**
I've used GitHub as a remote repository to push and store the committed changes to my project from Git. I've also used GitHub pages to deploy my website in a live environment.

## Testing

**For Responsive Design**
I used Google Chrome's Development tools constantly test each change that I made to my website and to ensure that it appeared in the desired way on different screen sizes. I also tested my website on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet and desktop) to ensure it appeared in the desired way on different devices.

## Testing Checklist
* HTML and CSS Validation 

- I used the W3C HTML Validator tool to validate my HTML code.

- I used the W3C CSS Validator tool to validate my CSS code.

- Interesting Bugs or Problems

## Challenges
My great challenge was javascript array itself and emoji icon. Some emoji would display but other wont't. When come to aligning each object in the page was challenging too.

The hosting platform that I've used for my project is GitHub Pages. To deploy my website to GitHub pages, I used the following steps:

Initialised Git using the git init command.

Added all files to the Staging area (Git) using the git add . command.

Committed the files to Git using the git commit -m "Initial commit" command.

Went into 'Settings' on my repository page in GitHub.

Selected the 'master branch' option under the 'GitHub Pages' section.

Ran several regular commits throughout my project.

* Running Code Locally

To run my code locally, users can download a local copy of my code to their desktop by completing the following steps:

1. Go to my GitHub repository.
2. Click on 'Clone or download'.
3. Click on 'Download ZIP'.
- Once dowloaded, extract the zip file's contents and run my website locally.

## Credits
I received inspiration for the full screen overlay menu when I was looking at websites for other games.

A special mention to my mentor, for his feedback on my project's scope and design, and for hints on what information to include in my README.md file to justify my stylistic choices.
